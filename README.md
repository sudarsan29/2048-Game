🧩 2048 Game – React Implementation

🎯 Objective

This project is a functional implementation of the popular 2048 Game, developed as part of a Full Stack Software Developer assignment. The goal of the game is to combine tiles with the same number to reach 2048 while maintaining dynamic gameplay and smooth UI updates.

🚀 Features

=> Interactive 4x4 grid with dynamic tile movements
=> Keyboard and button controls (Up, Down, Left, Right)
=> Automatic new tile generation (2 or 4) after each valid move
=> Score tracking based on merged tiles
=> Game-over detection (when no valid moves left)
=> Restart button to start a new game anytime
=> Built with a responsive and modern UI using Tailwind CSS.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Language: JavaScript (ES6+)

🧠 Game Rules

=> Use arrow keys or on-screen controls to slide tiles.
=> When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with their sum value.
=> After every move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears in a random empty spot.
=> The game ends when:
    => You reach 2048, or
    => No more moves are possible.

🏗️ Installation and Setup

1️⃣ Clone the repository: 
=> https://github.com/sudarsan29/2048-Game
=> cd 2048-game

2️⃣ Install dependencies
=> npm install

3️⃣ Start the development server
=> npm start

🧩 Functional Programming Principles

=> Pure functions are used to handle grid updates and merging logic.
=> State management with React Hooks ensures the UI re-renders efficiently after each move.
=> The logic for tile movements and merges is modular and reusable for scalability.
